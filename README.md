# HPcurrency

This package was created for a final project. It has functions that convert the currency used in Harry Potter between itself (Knuts, Sickles, Galleons), 
and also provides conversion to British Pounds. 

For anyone familiar with the Harry Potter universe, you will know that the currency used does not have a standard conversion rate between units. 
The conversion between units is listed in the books, and I found the conversion to British Pounds on the HP Lexicon here:
